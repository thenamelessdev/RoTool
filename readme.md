## RoTool
A Roblox extension
## Installion
Sadly I can't publish it to the Chrome Web store because of the requirements.

Firstly clone or get the repo's source code then run `npm install` to install the packages. After that you can run `npx vite build` to build it. You will get the output in the dist/ folder. After building you can go to your extensions page (at chrome://extensions on Chromium based browsers) and press Load Unpacked (after enableing developer mode) then select the dist folder (the output) and you are done!
